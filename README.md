ðŸ’ŠSEHAT AUR SAHULAT
This project aims to develop an Online Hospital System that enables
users to find doctors based on their location and budget. Users can input
their desired budget range and location to view a tailored list of
available doctors. They can then book appointments with their chosen
doctor directly through the platform, providing a more accessible and
convenient healthcare experience
